# Knowledge Base

## Background
I'm fortunate enough to get to spend a lot of time reading technology related books and articles, following tutorials and hacking with different technologies. This allows me to continually learn and acquire new knowledge. 

I enjoy sharing this with others. Currently one of the main ways that I do this is by keeping a reasonably well curated bookmark list in Chrome. When I share it, it is usually one or two links as I often don't know how in-depth the person wants to go. So I wanted to create this repo to make it easier to share my bookmarks and other knowledge.

You might ask, why bother when people can just use Google. It is not always that easy to find good material and you have to know what you are looking for. I will try to keep the content to things that aren't easy to find using Google and that i've found useful myself.
